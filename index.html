        <h5>To visualize the heat captured by human-made pollution entering the atmosphere every day, imagine detonating 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs. 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
Humans create 110 million tons of pollution everyday resulting in what we are experiencing: rising sea levels, unprecedented storms, longer droughts, wildlife extinction and far reaching pandemics. In one way or another, everyone has felt the effects and are guaranteed to feel them more in the coming future. Backed by nearly all of the global scientific community, close to 200 governments and millions of citizens around the world, we are experiencing global warming. If we keep living the way we do, more land will become inhospitable, food shortages more frequent, mass migrations will result, and there’s potential for the sixth mass extinction in world history. Thankfully, nearly 200 countries signed a plan known as the Paris Climate Agreement to keep average global temperatures within 1.5℃ above the average pre-industrial era temperatures. However, a report in October, 2018 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) discovered the temperature projection isn’t under 1.5℃ , but is on track to reach 3℃ : a level of global warming seen to be dicing with the survival of life on Earth. Calling for major change over the span of decades, the plan now has to take place over a mere 12 years where IPCC calls for decreasing CO2 emissions by 45% and pushing forth additional policies in the Paris Agreement, like net zero emissions, at a faster and more aggressive pace. Moving forward, it is becoming a defining era of human history as we face one of our greatest challenges to date.</h5>

      <p>With rising global temperatures, major impacts are being felt
      internationally. Temperatures are becoming dangerously above average, extreme weather is becoming worse with hurricanes like Maria and
      Harvey, pandemics more widespread, forest fires more uncontrollable, sea
      levels are rising, more global droughts and greater mass extinctions. Turning
      on the news is like "...a nature hike through the book of revelation” as Al
      Gore puts it.</p>

      <p>The agreement is an international deal of nearly 200 countries uniting together to work to
      overcome climate change by cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. The
      main goal of the plan calls for keeping global temperature rises under
      1.5℃ above pre-industrial levels. However, a recent report
      found that global temperature rises are expected to reach 1.5℃ in the next

    <h1>What Can Be Done</h1>
    <div class  = "row WCBD">
      <div class = "col-md-3 text-center">
        <h3>Food Consumption </h3>
        <p>Removing beef for substitutes such as pork, chicken, soya beans and
           cod can drastically reduce CO2 emissions Buy less meat, milk, cheese,
           and butter and substitute commercial products for more local foods.
           Consider new food options that provide the same nutrients but require
           less energy to produce.</p>

      </div>
      <div class = "col-md-3 text-center">
      <h3>Improve Home's Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <p> By living in smaller homes, yearly savings on energy per household
        can increase between 8-24%. Beyond moving homes, savings can be made by
        just consuming less energy at home. This can be turning off lights, using
        less hot water and heating and using more eco-friendly lights and insulation.
        Smart thermostats like Nest have shown to save 21-26% on energy consumption.</p>

      </div>
      <div class = "col-md-3 text-center">
        <h3>Travel Less and Travel Clean </h3>
        <p> Think about biking or walking short distances rather than driving.
        This alone could decrease transport emissions by 62%. When driving,
        consider public transportation or electric vehicles. And when needing
        long distance travel, consider driving to save on emissions. And if
        traveling for business consider video conferences instead.</p>

        <h3>Spread Awareness of Global Warming</h3>
        <p> Global warming is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today
        and not only requires political support and scientific advancement, but a
        large support from the public. As of 2016 only 5% of Americans header
        people they know talking of global warming at least once a week. </p>
